I'm currently a college student at the Univeristy of Hawaii at Manoa, looking for job opportunities as I'm in my final semester. I work as a Web Application Developer at the University of Hawaii Information Technology Services department.

If you see a bunch of weird commits/repos don't worry about them, I'm just trying new things! :')

Right now I'm working on..
* Learning React in-depth
* Refreshing my knowledge on Spring
* x86 Assembly (for one of my classes)
* Python data science stuff (pandas, matplotlib, etc)
